<h1>Abdussalam's Top 3 Movies in 2023</h1>
    
<p>This are the top three movies i watched this year.<br/> 
    I really enjoyed them</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Business Proposal</h3>
<p>
    Talk about the perfect korean romantic movie to remind you that, rich kids are not on your level.<br/>
    It was a beautiful watch to say the least.
</p>

<h3>Itaewon Class</h3>
<p>
    If the quote, struggle makes you stronger was a person.
    <br/>It'll be Saeyori.

    This movie shows why you should neve undermine your values even when all hoppes seems lost.
    It never is. Hope is in you.
</p>

<h3>Blue Lock</h3>
<p>
    I know...<br/>
    I know...<br/>
    It's not a movie, but iit had to be on the list.
    Blue lock has been a wonderful anime and manga that lays emphasis on physchology and self-improvemnt.<br>
    If you consider yourself ambitious, this would add more fire to your burning desire
